Sure, Tani Sparkle! Here are the answers for questions 11 and 12 in the same format: Aim, Algorithm, Procedure, Execution, Output.


---

11. Install MVT (Mobile Verification Toolkit) on your system using pip


---

Aim:

To install Mobile Verification Toolkit (MVT) on a computer system using pip, in order to analyze mobile devices for potential threats or spyware.


---

Algorithm:

1. Ensure Python and pip are installed on your system.


2. Use the pip command to install MVT.


3. Verify that the installation is successful by checking the version or help command.




---

Procedure:

1. Open Terminal (Linux/Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows).


2. Check if Python is installed:

python --version

or

python3 --version


3. Check if pip is installed:

pip --version

or

pip3 --version


4. Install MVT using pip:

pip install mvt


5. (Optional): To install with Android and iOS dependencies:

pip install mvt[android]
pip install mvt[ios]


6. Verify installation:

mvt --help




---

Execution:

pip install mvt
mvt --help


---

Output:

MVT installed successfully.

You can now use commands like:

mvt-android – for Android analysis

mvt-ios – for iPhone analysis


Example output of mvt --help shows available subcommands and options.

12. Connect an Android device using adb and list all installed apps with their package names


---

Aim:

To connect an Android device using ADB and list all installed applications along with their package names for further analysis or management.


---

Algorithm:

1. Enable USB Debugging on the Android device.


2. Connect the device to the PC using a USB cable.


3. Use ADB to detect the device.


4. Use ADB shell command to list all installed package names.




---

Procedure:

1. Enable Developer Options and USB Debugging on your Android device:

Go to Settings > About phone > Tap 'Build number' 7 times

Then go to Developer options > Enable USB Debugging



2. Connect the device to your PC with a USB cable.


3. Check if the device is detected:

adb devices


4. List all installed packages:

adb shell pm list packages


5. (Optional): To filter system or user apps:

Only system apps:

adb shell pm list packages -s

Only user-installed apps:

adb shell pm list packages -3





---

Execution:

adb devices
adb shell pm list packages


---

Output:

List of package names like:

package:com.whatsapp
package:com.android.chrome
package:com.instagram.android
package:com.android.settings


These are the internal identifiers for each app, which can be used for app analysis, uninstalling, or backup.

Here is the structured format for locating and extracting call log database files from an Android device's disk image:


---

Aim:

To locate and extract the call log database files from an Android device’s disk image for forensic or diagnostic analysis.


---

Algorithm:

1. Mount or access the Android disk image.


2. Navigate the internal file system to locate the call log database.


3. Extract the relevant .db file(s) from the appropriate directory.


4. (Optional) Use SQLite tools to read and analyze the contents.




---

Procedure:

1. Obtain or mount the disk image:

Use a tool like Autopsy, FTK Imager, or the mount command (Linux) to access the file system.

If using Linux:

sudo mount -o loop system.img /mnt/android



2. Navigate to the call log database location:

On most Android devices, call logs are stored in:

/data/data/com.android.providers.contacts/databases/

The file to look for is usually named:

contacts2.db



3. Extract the call log database file:

Copy the contacts2.db file to your analysis system:

cp /mnt/android/data/data/com.android.providers.contacts/databases/contacts2.db .



4. (Optional) Use SQLite to read call logs:

Open the database:

sqlite3 contacts2.db

View call log table:

SELECT * FROM calls;





---

Execution:

On a Linux system:

sudo mount -o loop system.img /mnt/android
cp /mnt/android/data/data/com.android.providers.contacts/databases/contacts2.db .
sqlite3 contacts2.db

Inside SQLite:

SELECT * FROM calls;


---

Output:

Extracted file: contacts2.db

Inside the file: Call log data, including:

Phone numbers

Call types (incoming, outgoing, missed)

Call duration

Timestamps



These logs are stored in the calls table and can be analyzed using forensic or database tools.

Here’s the structured answer for using ADB to collect system logs and diagnostic data, just like the previous one:


---

Aim:

To use ADB (Android Debug Bridge) to collect system logs and diagnostic data from an Android device for troubleshooting and analysis.


---

Algorithm:

1. Connect the Android device to a computer via USB.


2. Enable USB Debugging on the Android device.


3. Use ADB commands to collect logs like logcat, dmesg, and dumpstate.


4. Save the collected data to a file for further diagnosis.




---

Procedure:

1. Enable USB Debugging:

Go to Settings > About phone > Tap 'Build number' 7 times.

Then go to Settings > Developer options > Enable USB Debugging.



2. Connect your device to your PC using a USB cable.


3. Check if the device is detected:

Open Command Prompt / Terminal.

Type:

adb devices

Ensure your device appears in the list.



4. Collect system logs using logcat:

Type:

adb logcat -d > logcat.txt

This saves the live log buffer to a file named logcat.txt.



5. Collect kernel logs using dmesg:

Type:

adb shell dmesg > dmesg.txt

This saves the kernel message log to dmesg.txt.



6. Collect a full diagnostic dump using dumpstate:

Type:

adb shell dumpstate > dumpstate.txt

This includes system info, services, settings, and logs.





---

Execution:

adb devices
adb logcat -d > logcat.txt
adb shell dmesg > dmesg.txt
adb shell dumpstate > dumpstate.txt

Sample result in terminal:

List of devices attached
XYZ987654    device
(logcat and other data saved successfully)


---

Output:

logcat.txt – Contains real-time application logs (errors, warnings, etc.)

dmesg.txt – Contains low-level kernel logs.

dumpstate.txt – Full system state and diagnostic info.

These files can be opened with any text editor or log analyzer for troubleshooting app crashes, system errors, or unusual behavior.

Here's the structured format for extracting a bug report from an Android device and saving it for analysis:


---

Aim:

To extract a bug report from an Android device using ADB (Android Debug Bridge) for debugging and analysis.


---

Algorithm:

1. Connect the Android device to a computer using a USB cable.


2. Enable Developer Options and USB Debugging on the Android device.


3. Use the ADB tool to initiate and save the bug report.


4. Analyze the saved bug report file for system and application logs.




---

Procedure:

1. Enable Developer Mode on the device:

Go to Settings > About phone > Tap 'Build number' 7 times until developer mode is enabled.

Then go to Settings > Developer options > Enable USB Debugging.



2. Connect the device to the PC using a USB cable.


3. Verify device connection:

Open Command Prompt / Terminal.

Type: adb devices

Confirm that your device is listed.



4. Extract the bug report:

Use this command:

adb bugreport bugreport.zip

This generates a compressed .zip file containing the full bug report.



5. Wait for the process to complete. It may take a few seconds to a few minutes depending on the device and system state.


6. Locate the saved file in your current directory with the name bugreport.zip.




---

Execution:

On the terminal:

adb devices
adb bugreport bugreport.zip

Sample response:

List of devices attached
XYZ123456    device
Bug report written to bugreport.zip


---

Output:

A file named bugreport.zip containing:

bugreport.txt – The main log with system details.

Additional logs and system state files.


This file can be opened using any text editor or analyzed with tools like Android Studio, Bugreport Viewer, or online parsers.
